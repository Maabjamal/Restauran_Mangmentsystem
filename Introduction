Introduction

Online Restaurant Management System is a process of ordering food from a restaurant or food corporative through a web page or app. Much like ordering consumer goods online, many of these allow customer to keep accounts with them in order to make frequent ordering convenient. A customer will search for favorite restaurant, usually filtered via type of cuisine and choose from available items, and choose delivery or pick-up. Customer can choose one or more items to place an order which will land in the Cart. Customer can view all the order details in the cart before checking out. At the end, customer gets order confirmation details.

Today, restaurant waiter takes the customer ordering by manual system with using paper. Restaurant management system puts the order in a queue with specific priority according to time and quantity. Initial problem is that the customer has to get connected over the phone; it would be harder if the restaurant is very popular and busy. Sometimes, waiter information and customer information is important to restaurant administrator for reference in the future. The chances of committing mistakes at the restaurant side in providing a menu list for a specific time would be more.
 
1.3 Proposed Solution
